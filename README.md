# FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images

![Header](images/teaser.png)

## Overview
FaceForensics++ is a forensics dataset consisting of 1000 original video sequences that have been manipulated with four automated face manipulation methods: Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures. The data has been sourced from 977 youtube videos and all videos contain a trackable mostly frontal face without occlusions which enables automated tampering methods to generate realistic forgeries. As we provide binary masks the data can be used for image and video classification as well as segmentation. In addition, we provide 1000 Deepfakes models to generate and augment new data.

## What is new

![ddd_samples](images/DDD_smaples.gif)

- __[Deep Fake Detection Dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/contributing-data-to-deepfake-detection.html):__ We are hosting the Deep Fake Detection Dataset provided by Google & JigSaw. The dataset contains over 3000 manipulated videos from 28 actors in various scenes. The dataset has a similar file structure and is downloaded by default together with the regular dataset. See the [dataset](dataset) page for more information. 

- __Neural Textures:__ We included a fourth manipulation method that does face manipulation using GANs and [Neural Textures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12356.pdf). All results have been updated to incorporate the new manipulation method and we have updated the benchmark as well. We refer to the paper for more information.
Unfortunately, we won't continue support on the old benchmark after this update, though you can still submit your models to the new benchmark by creating a new submission.

## Access
If you would like to download the FaceForensics++ dataset, please fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRRR3L5zAv6tQ_CKxmK4W96tAab_pfBu2EKAgQbeDVhmXagg/viewform) and, once accepted, we will send you the link to our download script.

If you have not received a response within a week, it is likely that your email is bouncing - please check this before sending repeat requests.

Once, you obtain the download link, please head to the [download section](dataset/README.md). You can also find details about the generation of the dataset there.

## [Benchmark](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/faceforensics_benchmark/)
We are offering an [automated benchmark](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/faceforensics_benchmark/) for facial manipulation detection on the presence of compression based on our manipulation methods that contains 1000 images. If you are interested to test your approach on unseen data, check it out! For more information, please consult [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08971). You can download the benchmark images [here](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/faceforensics_benchmark_example_submission.zip).


## Original FaceForensics
